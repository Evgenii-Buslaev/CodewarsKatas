/* This kata is the performance version of Don't give me five by user5036852.

Your mission, should you accept it, is to return the count of all integers in a given range which do not contain the digit 5 (in base 10 representation).
You are given the start and the end of the integer range. The start and the end are both inclusive.

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> return 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> return 12
The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start will always be smaller than the end. Both numbers can be also negative.

The regions can be very large and there will be a large number of test cases. So brute force solutions will certainly time out!

Good luck, warrior!
